# Bank_loan-Data-analysis-Dashboard
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project focused on building an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze key performance indicators across bank loan applications, funding, and repayments. It includes detailed metrics such as loan amounts, interest rates, and borrower risk profiles, with monthly trends and segmentation by loan type and borrower characteristics. Through visualizations and a comprehensive grid view, the dashboard empowers data-driven decisions.
## Dataset used 
-< href ="https://github.com/001Lucky/Bank_loans-Data-analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/financial_loan.zip>Dataset </a>
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1.	Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2.	Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3.	Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
4.	Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
## Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio
## Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s
Good Loan Application Percentage,Good Loan Applications,Good Loan Funded Amount and Good Loan Total Received Amount
Bad Loan
Bad Loan Application Percentage,Bad Loan Applications,Bad Loan Funded Amount and Bad Loan Total Received Amount

## DASHBOARD : OVERVIEW CHARTS
1.	Monthly Trends by Issue Date :  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
2.	Regional Analysis by State : To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
3.	Loan Term Analysis: To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4.	Employee Length Analysis : How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5.	Loan Purpose Breakdown : Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
6.	Home Ownership Analysis : For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
## DASHBOARD: Details
GRID
Need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
